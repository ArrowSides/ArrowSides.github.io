Yesterday, my webserver broke down, so I spent too much time on it. I found that there were some people who scanned webserver in the Internet and they took a brute force method to find my username and password. I was too angry to limit the login ip which can restrict the login user. Meanwhile, I knew that I was a newbie and I need to study constantly. I should contrive to make me stronger and to be a excellent security engineer. The next day is more difficult for me. I am obliged to strain every nerve to prepare my National Postgraduate Entrance Examination.
