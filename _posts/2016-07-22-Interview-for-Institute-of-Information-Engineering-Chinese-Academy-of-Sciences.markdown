Today I come to attend the assessment in Beijing for my master's school. I have applied the Institute of information int Chinese Academy of Sciences. The most important achievements that I got is I make the best interview for me.I expressed my advantages and the learning situations in great detail. At the same time, I am satisfied with the response of the questions that the teachers referred to. I think my English is still poor and I need to take more time to practise it and try to communicate with foreigners frequency.
