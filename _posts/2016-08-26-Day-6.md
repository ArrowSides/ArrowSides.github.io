Tomorrow, I will go back school and I will meet my classmates. I lost at once but it is not the end. Yet, it is a beginning. I obtain a chance to reexamine myself, in addition, I need to brave enough to face the road in my eyes. There is no room for retreat to me. Therefore I am obliged to grasp the nettle and fight for the future.
