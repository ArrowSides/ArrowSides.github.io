Today is the second day that I knew the terrible result of Cet6.I still don't pass the English Exam. I have finished all the paper that I bought, yet the result is more awful. But I gain the more important thing which can brace me for the next challenge. 

I understand the goal that blongs to me. When I climbed the Taibai Mountains, I kept myself clear-mind and I knew I need to try my best to climb the highest peak which many people give up going on moving. The process of pursuiting the goal can make you more powerful and brave. You know what you want and you know you can not be easy to gain it. You are willing to fight for the beautiful scenery that anyone else can't reach easily. You can enjoy the accomplishment you attain.

So I want to say to myself that you can do more than now. If you insist studying, you can be a great man.
