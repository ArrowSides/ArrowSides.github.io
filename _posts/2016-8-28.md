Today is the first day that I prepare for my National Postgraduate Entrance Examination. I learn more from my best friend, Yang Haodong. I know what I should learn now and which book I am obliged to read. I appreciate him a lot. When you are in trouble and you lost yourself, you demand something to sustain youself. You are willing to see the bright sight and you will be full of courages.
Hardship can not let you down but you will be capable of a new man. You dare to face them and overcome them to let you reborn. After the human body has undergone the huge pain and the samsara they can be able a happier rebirth.

Quote:How deep I love you, the moon represents my heart. 
Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has courage to lose sight of the shore.
