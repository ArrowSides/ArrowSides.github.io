I have read a book named devil mathmatic. Since the summer vocation started, I have read this book for about a month.It is a book about the math in our life. Everywhere in our life, we use math to solve the problems we meet unconscious. The most important aspect for me is that I need to rationally treat the decision. I need to make a reasonable decision when I should make a choice.

Today, I also have a thought of giving up myself. It is very dangerous for me because I need to trust myself whenever others don't trust or look down upon me. I just need to believe in myself and follow my plan. Never give up even if I meet the great obstracles.
