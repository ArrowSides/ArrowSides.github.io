The depression sometimes is the part of your life. If you find the life is tough, it must happen that you make progress. Maybe you admire that others own spare time to do what they want to do. But you can think of easily that you spand your time on the thing let you know what you will do next. You have a chance to make you stronger. Today, I also meet my future teammates. They must be easy-going partners for me. What you lost will come back later.

Quote: You lost the people you love and you have to find a way to go on. Then let it go and say goodbye with a smile. Although it won't be easy.
