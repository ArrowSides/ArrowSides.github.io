Today, the last two day of Rio Olympic Games, in the women vollyball final game, Chinese women vollyball team accomplished the 12-year dream that we gain a gold medal of women vollyball game in the Olympic games. In the 12 years ago, when we were behind the Russia team of two games, maybe everyone thought the Russia team would win this gold medal at that time. But our team members never gave up struggling for the championship. They treated every point as the final point and tried their best to attain it. In the end, they made the impossible to be possible. They beat the Russia team with 3:2. They made history and won the second gold medal in this event.

It is the same with me that I should not give up hopes, dreams and future. Although I missed the best opportunity of my college life, I harvested the power of seeking the better myself. I knew what I could do and what I should do to make me stronger. I believe that I can do all the time.
