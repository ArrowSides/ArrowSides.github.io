Sometimes maybe I rely on others so much that I forget to make efforts for myself. I put my hopes on the lucky, not efforts. I expect the reality can be wonderful and just do a little things. But the fact can not cheat myself which makes me feel down and even breaks my heart. The last part of an endeavor is the hardest to finish. I am supposed to never slack and concentrate on the thing I need to do. After all, there is no failure begin well and end well.

Today's quotes: Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored.
