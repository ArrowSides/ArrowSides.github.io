It is the second day after I come back school and also the first day of this semester. I couldn't control my tamper when I called my mother on the road back to my dormitory. At that time, I felt down and I lost all hope of the future. I made effort for my future but it didn't pay off. The giant drop can make me confused and I lose my way. I hope what I did can reward myself. But it didn't. All of this experience makes me know I should become more and more smart to make effort as little as possible to accomplish my goal. I need to identify my goal firmly so that I am capable of concentrate on the target. I cheer myself up.
